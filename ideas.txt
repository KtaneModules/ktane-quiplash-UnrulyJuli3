If the average number of vowels in each answer (rounded down) added to the sum of the numbers in the serial number is greater than 15, choose the left answer bubble.
Example: "abcde" (2) + "efghi" (2) + "aeis" (3) = 2.5 = 2 + "EX1CD5" (6) = 8

Avg number of vowels in each answer rounded down / 15 * 3 modulo 3
For example, "abcde" (2) + "efghi" (2) + "aeis" (5) = 3 / 15 * 3 rounded up is 1 modulo 3 is still 1 so you would choose the left answer.

Otherwise, if there is a third answer and the third answer has an even number of vowels, choose the JINX button.
Otherwise, if there are more than 2 batteries on the bomb, choose the right answer bubble.
Otherwise, choose the left answer bubble.
